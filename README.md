## Data Structures
### Arrays and Strings
**1.1 Is Unique:** Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

**1.2 Check Permutation:** Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

**1.3 URLify:** Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

**1.4 Palindrome Permutation:** Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

**1.5 One Away:** There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character and replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are within one edit of each other.

**1.6 String Compression:** Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).

**1.7 Rotate Matrix:** Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

**1.8 Zero Matrix:** Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

**1.9 String Rotation:** Assume you have a method `isSubstring` which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, `s1` and `s2`, write code to check if `s2` is a rotation of `s1` using only once call to `isSubstring` (e.g., "`waterbottle`" is a rotation of "`erbottlewat`").
